Learned a little bit about [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and how it can be integrated into GitHub Pages, just like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) can.

I'm considering using some of the themes found in Hugo (or maybe Jekyll) to launch the portal with training materials for Biodiversity Bioinformatics/Symbiota.
