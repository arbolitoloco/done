Learned how to use a tool called [purifycss](https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss) to clean a very large stylesheet. I had to copy only partial styles from this file to a different website, so using purifycss was extremely helpful. I've used it using npm and it was as simple as whitelisting a few classes and, voi-lรก!, CSS file went from 12k lines to 3k in a few seconds. Will definitely use it again.
