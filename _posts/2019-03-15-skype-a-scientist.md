[Skype a Scientist](https://www.skypeascientist.com/) is an initiative that "matches scientists with classrooms around the world". Their goal is to "give students the opportunity to get to know a “real scientist”."

I was matched with Teacher Jackie Gray and her first grade class students at Euclid Elementary School, in Mt. Prospect, IL, USA.

We had a great time talking about my work as a beetle-expert/biologist and also as a Brazilian immigrant living in the US. The children were really excited and asked many interesting questions about bugs and science. My favorite question was: "how do bugs poop?". I'd recommend that all my scientist friends/peers join this program. My initial motivation was to show kids that women are scientists, too, and I think that was also accomplished.
