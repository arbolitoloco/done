Found a less tedious way of updating this blog. Since it's published with Jekyll, which is a static site generator, manually adding new posts is a little labour-intensive. So I did a bit of googling and came up with a bash script to automatically generate post files from the command line.

The file is found [here](https://github.com/arbolitoloco/done/blob/master/_posts/newpost.sh) and instructions are contained in it. Script should be added to the folder where the file is going to be created (in my case, my local instance of the repo).
