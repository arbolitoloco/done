If you want to run a bash script or command on Windows, and you can't install it using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, but you have Git installed, you can use Git Bash terminal instead and be merry. Just open the program at (Program Files/Git/git-bash.exe) and run your scripts/commands normally. Fun!
