This is a little journal documenting cool things I've learned, made or tried.
May also contain ideas and annotations for future projects, random ramblings or eureka moments.

This page is maintained and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/arbolitoloco/done), made with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) based on the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme, modified by me.
